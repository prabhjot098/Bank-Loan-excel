# Building a Comprehensive Bank Loan Report Dashboard in Excel

In today’s data-centric banking environment, monitoring lending performance is crucial for making informed, strategic decisions. I recently developed a **Bank Loan Report Dashboard** in **Excel** for a bank, aimed at providing a clear view of loan portfolio health, tracking key performance indicators (KPIs), and identifying trends in lending activities. This dashboard allows the bank to assess the quality of its loan portfolio and make data-driven adjustments.

## Problem Statement Overview

The bank sought an intuitive dashboard to analyze loan data with specific objectives, such as:

- Offering insights into total loan applications and funded amounts, including **Month-to-Date (MTD)** and **Month-over-Month (MoM)** performance metrics.
- Tracking trends in **total repayments received** and **average interest rates** across all loans.
- Providing a breakdown of loans categorized as **Good Loans** or **Bad Loans** based on repayment status.
- Displaying loan metrics by borrower characteristics like **employment length**, **loan purpose**, and **home ownership status**.

To meet these needs, the dashboard was organized into two primary sections:

1. **Summary Dashboard**: Provides a high-level overview of essential loan KPIs, enabling managers to get quick insights into loan performance.
2. **Overview Dashboard**: Delivers a detailed analysis of loan trends and borrower demographics, empowering strategic insights and targeted actions.

## Dashboard Descriptions

### Summary Dashboard

#### Purpose
The **Summary Dashboard** is designed to give bank managers an overview of critical KPIs, allowing for rapid assessment of the bank’s lending portfolio. This dashboard provides quick insights into total loan applications, funded amounts, and repayment flows, supporting the bank’s daily decision-making processes.

#### Key Features

- **Total Loan Applications**: Shows the overall count of loan applications within a specified period. The **MTD** and **MoM** metrics reveal growth or decline in loan applications over time.
- **Total Funded Amount**: Displays the cumulative funds disbursed as loans, with MTD and MoM tracking to highlight recent funding trends.
- **Total Amount Received**: Tracks all repayments received from borrowers, offering insights into cash flow with MTD and MoM comparisons.
- **Average Interest Rate**: Calculates the average interest rate across all loans, with MTD and MoM variations, providing insight into portfolio pricing.
- **Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)**: Shows the average DTI ratio of borrowers, which is a key indicator of borrower financial health. MoM changes reveal trends in borrower stability.
- **Good Loan vs. Bad Loan KPIs**: Categorizes loans into 'Good' or 'Bad' based on loan status, enabling assessment of loan quality and portfolio risk.

This high-level dashboard serves as a control panel, equipping managers with concise views of critical metrics to facilitate portfolio oversight.

### Overview Dashboard

#### Purpose
The **Overview Dashboard** offers a more detailed analysis, enabling managers to dive into segmented loan data. This dashboard is perfect for understanding trends over time, assessing borrower demographics, and analyzing loan purposes to support strategic decision-making.

## Bank Loan Overview Dashboard

#### Key Features

- **Monthly Trends by Issue Date (Line Chart)**: Displays trends in **Total Loan Applications**, **Total Funded Amount**, and **Total Amount Received** over time, allowing managers to identify seasonal patterns and forecast loan demand.
- **Regional Analysis by State (Map Chart)**: A geographic view of loan data, showing metrics by region (state) to highlight areas with high or low lending activity.
- **Loan Term Analysis (Donut Chart)**: Illustrates loan distribution by term length (e.g., 36 months, 60 months), providing insights into borrower preferences.
- **Employment Length Analysis (Bar Chart)**: Shows lending metrics across different employment length categories, revealing how job stability influences loan applications.
- **Loan Purpose Breakdown (Bar Chart)**: Breaks down loan data by loan purpose (e.g., debt consolidation, credit card refinancing), helping managers understand why borrowers are seeking loans.
- **Home Ownership Analysis (Tree Map)**: Categorizes loan data by home ownership status (own, rent, mortgage), giving a hierarchical view of how this factor impacts loan applications and risk.

With its detailed, visual breakdowns, the Overview Dashboard is ideal for managers seeking deeper, actionable insights.

## Steps to Build the Dashboard

To create this dynamic Excel dashboard, I followed a structured process:

### 1. Data Collection and Preparation
I started by gathering loan data, including fields such as loan application date, funded amount, received amount, interest rates, DTI, and borrower demographics. I cleaned and standardized the data, ensuring consistent formats and removing duplicates.

### 2. Creating KPI Calculations
Using Excel functions, I calculated essential KPIs:
- **Total Loan Applications**: Count of applications received.
- **Total Funded Amount**: Sum of loan disbursements.
- **Total Amount Received**: Total repayments received.
- **Average Interest Rate**: Average rate across loans.
- **Average DTI**: Average DTI of borrowers.

These calculations enabled the dashboard’s dynamic metrics, such as MTD and MoM trends.

### 3. Designing the Dashboard Layout
I created a clean, intuitive layout:
- The **Summary Dashboard** presents KPIs in a top-down view, while **Overview Dashboard** offers visual charts for trend analysis.
- Key metrics were displayed prominently, using contrasting colors and fonts to enhance readability.

### 4. Adding Visualizations
To make the dashboard visually engaging, I added charts and maps:
- **Line Charts** for trends over time (loan applications, funded amounts, repayments).
- **Donut Charts** to show loan term distributions.
- **Map Charts** for regional data.
- **Bar and Tree Maps** to explore borrower demographics and loan purposes.

### 5. Applying Filters for Interactivity
I incorporated slicers for filtering data by time, region, and loan status. These slicers allow managers to quickly adjust views, enabling focused analysis of specific data segments.

### 6. Final Touches and Formatting
Finally, I applied consistent colors, themes, and fonts. Metrics were formatted with currency symbols, and charts were adjusted for optimal clarity.

## Challenges and Solutions

One challenge was ensuring data accuracy in calculations for MTD and MoM comparisons. To resolve this, I used Excel’s **SUMIF** and **AVERAGEIF** functions with date filters to calculate metrics accurately, ensuring reliable monthly comparisons.

## Conclusion

The Bank Loan Report Dashboard offers a powerful tool for tracking and managing a bank’s lending portfolio. By visualizing critical KPIs and providing detailed analyses of borrower demographics, loan terms, and regional activity, this dashboard enables bank managers to make well-informed decisions, optimize lending strategies, and maintain portfolio health. With Excel’s capabilities, the dashboard brings actionable insights to the forefront of loan management, supporting the bank in its mission to make data-driven lending decisions.
